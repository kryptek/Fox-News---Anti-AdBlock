# FoxNews-Adblock
This userscript started out as a way to disable the sites rediculous Anti-AdBlock nag windows.  However I decided to add teh following 4 features.

- Disable anti-AdBlocker
- Hide clickbait
- Hide sidebars (disabled by default)
- Hide comments (disabled by default)


1.) Install TamperMonkey [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)


2.) Create a new script


3.) Paste in the source code and save.


4.) Enjoy
